    Signed-off-by: Ryan Newell <mailto:ryanewel@amazon.com>
  * Increase test timeout to fix flakiness (#21 <https://github.com/aws-robotics/cloudwatch-common/issues/21>)
    - Increase the test timeout to 5000ms because sometimes
    SendLogsToCloudWatch isn't being called fast enough and so the tests
    fail.

    - Call DescribeLogStreams only one on startup
    - Implements a state machine to manage the core run loop instead of checking if the log stream exists every tick.
